  - Azure Portal: You can use the Azure portal's query editor for basic database interactions.
  - SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS): Connect to your Azure SQL Database using SSMS.
  - Azure Data Studio: A cross-platform tool that allows you to connect to and manage Azure SQL Databases.
  - Connection Strings: You'll need connection strings (server name, database name, authentication details) to connect from applications.

## Using Azue Static Web Apps Service
Started fast and finish faster with source code integration from GitHub, live debugging, and one-click publish directly from Microsoft Visual Studio IDE. Easily connect to your database of choice, and tap into an ecosystem of OSS packages, APIs, connectors, and services through the Azure Marketplace, expediting development. Quickly add custom domains and SSL, single sign-on (SSO) integration with popular identity providers, and application health monitoring to your apps with the Azure portal.
1. Create a Web App: Log in to the Azure portal (portal.azure.com) and click on "Create a resource." Search for "Web App" and click on "Create" to start the creation process.
2. Configure Web App Settings: In the creation wizard, you'll need to provide details such as the subscription, resource group, and a unique name for your Web App. You'll also need to select the operating system (Windows or Linux) and the runtime stack (e.g., Node.js, .NET, Python, PHP, etc.) that your website requires.
3. Configure App Service Plan: An App Service Plan defines the location, size, and scale of the underlying infrastructure for your Web App. You can choose an existing plan or create a new one.
4. Deployment Options: Once the Web App is created, go to the "Deployment Center" in the Azure portal. Here, you can choose from various deployment options, such as Azure Pipelines, GitHub, Bitbucket, Local Git, or FTP. Select the option that suits your development workflow and connect your repository.
5. Configure Deployment Source: Configure the deployment source, and Azure will automatically build and deploy your website whenever you push changes to the connected repository.
6. Configure Custom Domains (Optional): If you have a custom domain for your website, you can configure it in the "Custom Domains" section of the Web App settings.
7. Enable HTTPS (Optional): You can enable HTTPS for your website by configuring a TLS/SSL certificate. Azure also provides a free certificate through Azure App Service Managed Certificates.
8. Scaling and Monitoring (Optional): Depending on your website's traffic, you can configure scaling options to automatically adjust the number of instances to handle increased load. Additionally, you can set up monitoring and alerts to keep track of the website's performance.
9. Testing and Verification: Once the deployment is complete, you can access your website using the URL provided in the Web App overview. Test the website thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.

## Initial ReadMe Commit By Nextjs 13
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
